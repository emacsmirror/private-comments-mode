* Customizing colors
Colors are defined via the =private-comments-face=. To customize the look, just override its defaults to something that works for you.

** Using Emacs' Easy Customize

The easiest way to customize the look of your private comments is to add a comment, and then run =M-x list-faces-display=

Search for =private-comments-face= and select it. Edit the foreground and background colors and click "Apply" to test out new colors. Once you've got something you like, click "Apply and Save" to save it for future sessions.

** Manual Customization

Choose your favorite foreground and background color combination and add it to your config as follows.

#+begin_src elisp
(with-eval-after-load "private-comments-mode"
  (set-face-background 'private-comments-face "#527568")
  (set-face-foreground 'private-comments-face "#FFFFFF"))
#+end_src


* Troubleshooting

=private-comments-apply: Failed=

This error indicates that the file in question has not been committed to git.
[The Private Comments system](https://github.com/masukomi/private_comments#readme) uses
git commit treeishes to know which comments apply to which versions of a file. As such
it can't work on files that haven't been committed.
